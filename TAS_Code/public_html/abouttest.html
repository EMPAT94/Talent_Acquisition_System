		Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung developed a theory early in the 20th century to describe basic 
		individual preferences and explain similarities and differences between people. <p> <br>

		The Carl Jung stated that <p><i><font size="3px">"when we are active and we are awake we think for a situation or condition in various 
		ways i.e. we find various alternatives for the same. Response differs from person to person. 
		When a situation is given the person either think about it internally i.e. by what their mind is thinking 
		and the other response could be in externally i.e. how the external conditions are and how the other 
		people react can affect the decision. The decisions are nothing but patterns."</font></i><p><br>
		
		The TAS test will tell you about which type of personality you belong to. It will not tell you that you should do this and that. 
		It involves client feedback and agreement. It inherits the strength and weakness of each pattern. It does not 
		judge you on how you look or whether you are going through any psychological problem it will only judge you on 
		what response you are giving to the situation. The output given by this test is accurate.
